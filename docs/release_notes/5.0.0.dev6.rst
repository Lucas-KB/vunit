Bug Fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Updated Visualizer support to also work with Questa 2024.2. (:vunit_issue:`1096`)


Features
~~~~~~~~

- Added support for running testbenches depending on a set of user-provided source files.

  The intended use case is to feed VUnit with files that have been changed since some point in time.
  The changes are typically provided by the version control system. (:vunit_issue:`1095`)
- Added support for repeating seeds from previous test run by setting the ``--seed`` option to ``repeat``. (:vunit_issue:`1113`)
- Added support for test prioritization with two goals in mind:

  1. Prioritize likely failures - Tests more likely to fail are executed earlier to provide faster feedback.
  2. Load balancing - When tests are executed in parallel using the -p option, VUnit will try to keep the threads balanced to minimize total execution time.

  Added the ``--changed`` option that limits tests to those that depend on changes made after the last test run. (:vunit_issue:`1114`)


Miscellaneous
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Updated handling of ``disable_ieee_warnings`` for NVC 1.16 and later. (:vunit_issue:`1098`)
